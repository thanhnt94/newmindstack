Vocab Flashcard Module Event Handlers
=====================================
Listens for external events and triggers module-specific actions.

This file is intentionally minimal. Add handlers here when:
- You need to respond to signals from other modules
- You want to perform cleanup/side-effects based on external events

Example use cases:
- Listen for user_deleted to clean up flashcard progress
- Listen for container_deleted to cancel active sessions

# Placeholder - add event handlers as needed

#     pass
